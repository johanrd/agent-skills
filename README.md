### vercel-deploy-claimable

Deploy applications and websites to Vercel instantly. Designed for use with claude.ai and Claude Desktop to enable deployments directly from conversations. Deployments are "claimable" - users can transfer ownership to their own Vercel account.

**Use when:**
- "Deploy my app"
- "Deploy this to production"
- "Push this live"
- "Deploy and give me the link"

**Features:**
- Auto-detects 40+ frameworks from `package.json`
- Returns preview URL (live site) and claim URL (transfer ownership)
- Handles static HTML projects automatically
- Excludes `node_modules` and `.git` from uploads

**How it works:**
1. Packages your project into a tarball
2. Detects framework (Next.js, Vite, Astro, etc.)
3. Uploads to deployment service
4. Returns preview URL and claim URL

**Output:**
```
Deployment successful!

Preview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app
Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...
```

## Installation

```bash
npx add-skill NullVoxPopuli/agent-skills
```

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.

**Examples:**
