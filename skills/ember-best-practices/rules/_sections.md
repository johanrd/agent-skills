## 1. Route Loading and Data Fetching (route)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Efficient route loading and parallel data fetching eliminate waterfalls. Using route model hooks effectively and loading data in parallel yields the largest performance gains.

## 2. Build and Bundle Optimization (bundle)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Using Embroider with static build optimizations, route-based code splitting, and proper imports reduces bundle size and improves Time to Interactive.

## 3. Component and Reactivity Optimization (component)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Proper use of Glimmer components, tracked properties, and avoiding unnecessary recomputation improves rendering performance.

## 4. Accessibility Best Practices (a11y)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Making applications accessible is critical. Use ember-a11y-testing, semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.

## 5. Service and State Management (service)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Description:** Efficient service patterns, proper dependency injection, and state management reduce redundant computations and API calls.

## 6. Template Optimization (template)

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Optimizing templates with proper helpers, avoiding expensive computations in templates, and using {{#each}} efficiently improves rendering speed.

## 7. Advanced Patterns (advanced)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Description:** Advanced patterns for specific cases including custom modifiers, renderless components, and performance monitoring.
