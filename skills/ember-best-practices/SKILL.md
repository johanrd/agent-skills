# Ember.js Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization and accessibility guide for Ember.js applications. Contains 20+ rules across 7 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new Ember components or routes
- Implementing data fetching with Ember Data
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing Ember.js code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times
- Implementing accessibility features

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Route Loading and Data Fetching | CRITICAL | `route-` |
| 2 | Build and Bundle Optimization | CRITICAL | `bundle-` |
| 3 | Component and Reactivity | HIGH | `component-` |
| 4 | Accessibility Best Practices | HIGH | `a11y-` |
| 5 | Service and State Management | MEDIUM-HIGH | `service-` |
| 6 | Template Optimization | MEDIUM | `template-` |
| 7 | Advanced Patterns | LOW-MEDIUM | `advanced-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Route Loading and Data Fetching (CRITICAL)

- `route-parallel-model` - Use RSVP.hash() for parallel data loading
- `route-loading-substates` - Implement loading substates for better UX
- `route-lazy-routes` - Use route-based code splitting with Embroider

### 2. Build and Bundle Optimization (CRITICAL)

- `bundle-direct-imports` - Import directly, avoid entire namespaces
- `bundle-embroider-static` - Enable Embroider static mode for tree-shaking
- `bundle-lazy-dependencies` - Lazy load heavy dependencies

### 3. Component and Reactivity Optimization (HIGH)

- `component-use-glimmer` - Use Glimmer components over classic components
- `component-cached-getters` - Use @cached for expensive computations
- `component-minimal-tracking` - Only track properties that affect rendering
- `component-tracked-toolbox` - Use tracked-built-ins for complex state

### 4. Accessibility Best Practices (HIGH)

- `a11y-automated-testing` - Use ember-a11y-testing for automated checks
- `a11y-semantic-html` - Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
- `a11y-keyboard-navigation` - Ensure full keyboard navigation support
- `a11y-form-labels` - Associate labels with inputs, announce errors
- `a11y-route-announcements` - Announce route transitions to screen readers

### 5. Service and State Management (MEDIUM-HIGH)

- `service-cache-responses` - Cache API responses in services
- `service-shared-state` - Use services for shared state
- `service-ember-data-optimization` - Optimize Ember Data queries

### 6. Template Optimization (MEDIUM)

- `template-let-helper` - Use {{#let}} to avoid recomputation
- `template-each-key` - Use {{#each}} with @key for efficient list updates
- `template-avoid-computation` - Move expensive work to cached getters

### 7. Advanced Patterns (LOW-MEDIUM)

- `advanced-modifiers` - Use modifiers for DOM side effects
- `advanced-helpers` - Extract reusable logic into helpers

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/route-parallel-model.md
rules/bundle-embroider-static.md
rules/a11y-automated-testing.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references

## Accessibility with OSS Tools

Ember has excellent accessibility support through community addons:

- **ember-a11y-testing** - Automated accessibility testing in your test suite
- **ember-a11y** - Route announcements and focus management
- **ember-focus-trap** - Focus trapping for modals and dialogs
- **ember-page-title** - Accessible page title management
- **ember-changeset-validations** - Accessible form validation

These tools provide comprehensive a11y support with minimal configuration.
